There three classes, A,B,C
The classed from a inheritance:C inherits from B, C inherits from A

a:
30 create an object a of class A, call f function
	out:A.f
31 create an object b of class B, call g function
	out:B.g
32 create an object of class A, call g function
	out:C.g

b

34 do not compile
	try so assign an object of base class A to an object of derived class B
35	object a1 of class A is constructed by copying the B object;
	out:A.f
36 same as 35
37 Polymorphie
	create a pointer to the base class A* and set this point to the object of deroved class B
	out:B.f
